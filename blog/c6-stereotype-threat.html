          I have felt stereotype threat in the past, as I elected to not go to college after high school but rather joined my family's business. I was left feeling judged by my friends, and some of my family at the time. I still feel as though there are judgments cast upon me now, when talking to people who have a college education. In my case, stereotype threat motivates me to prove the people who are casting those judgments wrong. When I witness others going through those same feelings of being judged, I try to motivate them as well by talking about all the reasons they can do it. I think that you need to address these things head on in life, and action is a powerful thing. I think the ideal environment to keep stereotype threat at a minimum is one where collaboration is wide-spread, which means that everyones' opinions/ideas are being respected and heard. That doesn't mean that you have to agree with everyone, but it does mean that you need to respect where other people are coming from.

          Well, those are my thoughts. I will do my best to promote a culture where everyone is being respected, and judgments are being reserved.
