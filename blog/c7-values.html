          One particular value that has major importance to me is growth. I thrive when I have the chance to progress and develop my personal and professional lives. This specific value, growth, has other values interwoven into it. When these opportunities come along, I feel empowered, challenged, controlled, responsible, independent, and enthusiastic. I feel that my growth is directly effected by my actions, and whether or not I make the most of the opportunity at hand. It feels amazing when I succeed at growing, but it feels really terrible when I fail.

        <h3>Recognizing Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <p>
          The values I feel when I'm the happiest, proudest, and most-satisfied in my life help me overcome stereotype threat because they make me feel affirmed and encouraged to accomplish what I can, and how I can. While I have a competitive nature and drive to my life, I feel I do a good job of keeping it under control and not keep myself from feeling defeated when I fail. I try to redirect my energy when I fail, or am being told I can't do something, from intimidation to creativity. I think creative process can help reaffirm one's self during times of failure and intimidation.

          I think another thing that can help reduce the effects of feeling down at DBC is music. I find that music can greatly effect my state of mind, it can inspire and motivate me. Music allows me to go into this safe zone, where I can really focus on what my needs are in the current situation. It takes me away to a new place where I am able to reset myself.
