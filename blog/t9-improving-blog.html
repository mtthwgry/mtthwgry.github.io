        <h3>They warned me about the rabbit hole.</h3>
        <p>
          I knew the warning was there for a reason. I should have heeded their sound advice, "Use best practices for time management! As you've already learned, it's easy to go down rabbit holes when you are working on your site." It was like I a drug, I found a Bootstrap theme I fell in love with, they even had a Jekyll implementation. I kept customizing, and tweaking, and fiddling.
        </p>
        <h3>I fiddled too much.</h3>
        <p>
          I should have stuck to my timeline. No, just one more tweak. And another. And another. I ended up tweaking something a little too far, buried deep in a style sheet. I should have stopped when the time was up, but I'm a perfectionist. In the end it was my perfectionist ways that had drawn me deep in to the customization trance that carried on for too long.
        </p>
        <h3>I have learned from my fiddling ways.</h3>
        <p>
          This was a good lesson for me and a pretty frustrating one. I find I learn well from frustration as I try to figure out a way to not be frustrated in the future. I will attempt to customize my layout once again, so please stay tuned.
