          Dev Bootcamp offers an alternative education experience. From the moment I went through their interview process, I knew it would be a great fit for my educational needs. The curriculum includes more than just teaching Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, they also include personal communication skills. The structure is set up to allow students to learn not only from instructors and mentors, but also their peers. I am really looking forward to learning from my peers, as well as teaching my peers, as I really value peer to peer learning.

          I am looking forward to getting involved with my Chicago cohort before we get on site. I think that having a strong set of relationships walking in the door, will be important to the success of my (and my cohort-mates) time and experience at Dev Bootcamp. I first learned about DBC at a ChicagoRuby Hacknight, where I paired with an instructor from the program. I didn't know about all of the empathy, social awareness, and personal communication skill building that are included in the program, all of which have no place in the traditional educational model in the United States. These additional opportunities to learn a life changing skill set are invaluable. I hope to start practicing these ideals during the Phase-0, and continue building upon them through out the rest of my life.

          I am really excited about what lies ahead in the DBC program. After going on a tour last Tuesday, meeting various alumni and instructors, I felt so welcomed into the DBC family. I learned valuable insight about how the program looks post graduation, and received advice for my success in the program. The strongest thing I left with is this: it's not about Ruby, or RoR, or Javascript, but it's about the other skills you learn while at the program (namely how to communicate effectively with peers). I have never been through an educational experience like the one offered at DBC, which makes me a little nervous. That said, part of the reason I never went to college was due to the way the educational model is setup in the United States. More than anything, I'm excited to learn and hope to soak up as much knowledge as I can during my time at Dev Bootcamp!
