          Version control is the process of tracking changes in files to allow for time machine like behavior, and eases the collaboration process within a development team. This time travelling through code allows you to roll back changes by typing a few select keystrokes. A team of developers can jointly work on a project at the same time and not worry about using deprecated, out of date source code. Version control allows you to set up a repository, which is a fancy term for the directory that contains all of your project files and folders.
        </p>

          Git is a type of version control that uses your command line interface to track changes within a repository. You can tell git exactly which files to track, and which to ignore. You can update files in a repository by adding them to the stage, and then committing (read: updating) them to the branch. All commits need a message that explains what the commit does, for example: "update user login page". See the list below of a few popular git commands:
          <ul>
            <li>`git init`: create a repository of the current directory (and all of its folders and files)</li>
            <li>`git status`: displays any current changes in the repo, since last commit</li>
            <li>`git add .`: adds all of the changed files to the stage</li>
            <li>`git add &lt;file&gt;`: adds a specific file or folder to the stage</li>
            <li>`git commit -m "message here"`: updates the staged files to the repo</li>
            <li>`git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;`: create a new branch</li>
            <li>`git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;`: switch to a branch</li>
          </ul>
          As you can see, git commands are pretty straight forward and are typically less than 5 words. Once you look past the initial intimidation of learning git, you'll find it is an essential tool for your development cycle.

          GitHub is a great addition to git, as it gives you a centralized place to store your repository. On GitHub, you can choose who to share your repo with, or you can share it with the entire world. It's social-coding at its best, as users can fork and clone a repository to their local machine, hack away to optimize some code or develop a new feature, and finally submit a pull request. When the author of a repo gets a pull request, they can review it and merge it to the master branch at their discretion.
