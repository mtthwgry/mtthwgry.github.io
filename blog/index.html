          Dev Bootcamp offers an alternative education experience. From the moment I went through their interview process, I knew it would be a great fit for my educational needs. The curriculum includes more than just teaching Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, they also include personal communication skills. The structure is set up to allow students to learn not only from instructors and mentors, but also their peers. I am really looking forward to learning from my peers, as well as teaching my peers, as I really value peer to peer learning.
