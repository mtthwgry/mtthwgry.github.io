          Concrete Random thinkers are creative problem solvers, self-directed, hands-on learners who don't like restrictions and limitations. As I read through <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Dr. Gregorc's Mind Style Models</a> and <a href="http://www.child1st.com/blog/the-concrete-random-learning-style/">The Concrete Random Learning Style</a> with my partner, I started to chuckle about how the qualities (some good, some bad) resonated with me in my own daily life. I looked over at my partner who was nodding her head in agreeance with the bullet points I rambled off about CR thinkers. Charming, Friendly, Charismatic: check! Self-driven by their interests: check! Risk taker: yep! Hates being told exactly what to do and how to do it: that's me! Hard time completing long-term projects: right here!
