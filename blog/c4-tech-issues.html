          It is widely known that privacy is not a guarantee when it comes down to a person's online life. Everything you do on the internet is being tracked by someone, or something. Just last week, Uber released a blog post about a specific type of ride which they called "Rides of Glory." They compiled a massive amount of data in 6 major metropolitan areas and made some correlations as to what behavior may be taking place (basically they were tracking the potential sex lives of people). I tend to believe that it is extremely creepy for them to pay people to study such a thing. Why would they compile such data? Money. Cold hard cash. There is an immense interest in user data these days, and people are trying to monetize the data as quick as they can. This is a potential gold mine for advertisers, to know specifically who they can target.

          While I'm not trying to pick on Uber, even though I have recently stopped using the service due to their recent <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists">threatening of a Journalist who was writing honest stories about them</a>, they have as a part of their "Privacy Policy" that they can, and will, keep your credit card information for as long as they want. I find this is a gigantic breach of any sort of decent privacy, and while they're purpose for keeping it on file may be for claims against you as a user, the fact that there is no remove button to delete your credit card from your profile, even if you want to delete your account. Which leads to another point: <a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-delete-your-uber-account/">you can delete your account but not your information</a>. This is actually something where Uber is in good company, and most companies out there don't delete your account, they simply deactivate it. The problem is that all of your data still exists.

          I won't even get in to the whole topic of Uber's God View, but I'll just leave <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/10/03/god-view-uber-allegedly-stalked-users-for-party-goers-viewing-pleasure/">this</a> here.

          Without regulation by the Governments of the World, practices like these can and will become the status quo. We need policies to be written to protect the user's data, and give them complete control of how they're data can be used and accessed. Yes, most every website has a some version of a "Privacy Policy" but have you ever read one in it's entirety? I haven't, and probably never will seeing as you need a JD with 15 years of practice under your belt just to understand it. The truth is that government regulation and the internet are not typically perceived to be a good thing (read: censorship), but in the case of a user's privacy something needs to happen. As users, we also have a say in the matter. We can boycott particular offenders of a user's privacy, and demand they change their policies and practices. Wouldn't you like to know how your data is being used?
