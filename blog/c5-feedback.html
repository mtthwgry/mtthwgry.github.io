          At Dev BootCamp, communication is synomymous with the word <em>feedback</em>. Feedback is supposed to be composed of 3 key elements: Actionable, Specific, and Kind. These 3 elements are sometimes difficult to keep in mind, but I have found them to be crucial in communicating with other boots. The problem with feedback is that it is only as good as what is given. If one of the 3 key elements is missing, the quality of the feedback drops. To quote an old CS saying:<em>Garbage in, garbage out.</em>

        <h3>Pairing is Caring</h3>
        <p>
          I would have to say the hardest adjustment for me in DBC, is the idea of pairing. This isn't to say I'm not a team player, but pairing is much different than being a team player. When you're pairing, you lose a lot of control over the situation. This is also not to say that I am a control freak, but for the majority of my adult life, I have really enjoyed taking control (read: ownership) of a project, or assignment, or event, or...this is actually a huge benefit for myself, as I am learning to share the responsibility of navigating through a project with another person and listening to their ideas.
        </p>

          The only thing that is frustrating about pairing, for me, is when my pair comes unprepared and without effort, tenacity, or creativity. We are all learning Ruby together, and I would say that no one is a Ruby master yet. Sure there are people in the program that have had previous exposure to one thing or another, but that really doesn't matter when it comes down to it. What matters is the critical thinking skills behind the syntax, it's not about why, but more about how. Fortunately, and unfortunately, this has happened to me once. I felt as though my pair was giving up because there was no effort, tenacity, or creativity being given.

        <h3>Feedback: Hot Mic</h3>
        <p>
          I think feedback is a great thing in DBC. While I sometimes dread having to write it, the process offers me a chance to reflect on what happened during the session, what worked and what didn't work. I really enjoy reading the feedback from my peers, it allows me to check myself on how I think a session went compared to another's point of view. I really appreciate when a specific detail is left, whether positive or constructive. It is a chance for me to step outside of my box and take a look at what I'm doing right, and what I'm doing wrong, which allows me to alter the way I communicate, learn, and teach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something I can work on in my pairing sessions is slowing down, explaining my code conceptually before implementing it and then trying to explain it once the cat is out of the bag. I tend to cut to the chase a little quick, implementing a piece of code without explaining the concept, and then reverse engineering the code (which works for my brain, but I'm not sure about others). I think that if we can work through the code conceptually first, a verbal psuedocode if you will, then the process of implementing the code will be smoother and take less time to explain (because there is an understanding of what we are trying to do).
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not particularly fond of writing feedback because I think it is going to take too much time. I just don't feel like I can convert the feelings and thoughts in my head into actionable, specific, and kind feedback. Now that I think about it, the only part I really have an issue with is the actionable part. I find it hard to come up with something that is actionable/constructive for each session. It's not that I don't see the value in leaving someone constructive feedback, because I really enjoy when I receive a great piece of feedback that is constructive. I think it is gradually becoming easier as I write more and more feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I think the whole idea of feedback is a really beautiful part of DBC. It is improving my communication skills not only with peers, but with loved ones as well. I find myself trying to express actionable, specific, and kind feedback through out my life.
