        <h3>This one time...</h3>
        <p>
          I had an altercation with a "bouncer" at a popular "roof top" lounge in Chicago. This place was literally five-hundred feet from the door to my apartment building, in the heart of River North. It was a Saturday. I had been at work. Some of my partner's friends and family were in town and decided I should meet them after I was done working to have a drink at this trendy "roof top" spot. I tried to gain access to this place, however the "bouncer" wouldn't let me in. He was pretty offensive in his interactions with me. I stated that I was meeting up with about ten people already inside the club. He asked for the reservation, to which he said they were not on the "list". Long story short, after about 10 minutes of arguing with this "bouncer", I was asked to leave. I had said some not so great things to this guy.
        </p>
        <h3>The Source.</h3>
        <p>
          I was pissed that I was being denied seeing people I love and care about. This "bouncer" was standing between me and a good time with family and friends. This "bouncer" was extremely "bouncerish" in his actions, which were extremely offensive to me. He never disclosed the reason for not allowing me in until one of the family members tried to come down to get me. I apparently wasn't dressed for this "roof top" lounge.
        </p>
        <h3>Conflict resolved?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, not so much. I instantly tweeted this establishment, stating what had happened, that I was a neighbor of theirs, that one of their "bouncers" had offended me. They ended up tweeting me back the next day stating that they were sorry, they had special deals for their neighbors, they wanted me to give them another try. Yeah, right. I ended up ignoring their apology and crossed that place off my list of things to do and see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the rest of the party knew I couldn't join them, we ended up going to another bar. We had just as good of a time as we would have had at the "roof top" lounge.
        </p>
        <h3>So, would you do it again?</h3>
        <p>
          If I had to go through this exact situation again, I wouldn't have argued with the "bouncer" or tweeted the company. I just had felt so offended, but in retrospect I had complete control over the situation. I shouldn't have said some of the things I said to the "bouncer" even if he may have been deserving of them. I should have left, rather than lower myself to this other person's level.
