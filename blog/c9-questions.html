        <h3>...there is however such a thing as a poorly asked question.</h3>
        <p>
          I recall a time early on in my work career, which started right after high school, when I would ask questions that I thought were meaningful to myself, but were actually quite unclear to others. This was because in my head I have the context of the problem I'm tyring to solve, and every once in a while I will ask an un-meaningful question expecting a meaningful answer. In more recent years, I have been more on the receiving end of poorly asked questions. I think a good question is one that is succinct, has context, and is interesting (which is highly subjective).
        </p>
        <h3>What makes a poorly asked question so poor?</h3>
        <p>
          There was a time when I would ask a question like, "It's not working, what should I do?", which led to many follow up questions from the person who was trying to help me. Q&amp;A sessions that start like this, end up turning in to more of a scavenger hunt where both sides either get frustrated, give up, or lose an incredible amount of time. This very broad, detail-less question is an example of what not to ask. A poorly asked question will result in bad answers, because the person answering the question is left to guess too much about what the question asker really wants to know. I have been on both sides of these types of questions and there are no winners.
        </p>
        <h3>What makes a well asked question so great?</h3>
        <p>
          Quite honestly, a good question has just the right amount of relevant contextual information, paired with the expected and actual outcomes. A better question, instead of "It's not working, what should I do?" would be: "Why does my VLOOKUP formula in Excel 2010 for Mac return N/A, when it should return a number?". This question has a lot more context, reveals the expected and actual outcomes. It is specific, but not overly verbose. A well asked question will contain no ambiguity, there will be a direct answer which should be able to be formed from the question itself. There is no room for guessing what the context of the question is, because the question contains its context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping the above information in mind when thinking through a problem can even increase the chances of you answering your own questions. Asking questions is a very important piece of communication, especially when navigating an unknown subject matter. I hope to increase my question asking ability during my time at DBC, and will definitely welcome any feedback about how I ask questions.
