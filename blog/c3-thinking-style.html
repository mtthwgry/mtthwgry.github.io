        <h2>Hello, my name is Matthew and I'm a concrete random thinker.</h2>
        <p>
          Concrete Random thinkers are creative problem solvers, self-directed, hands-on learners who don't like restrictions and limitations. As I read through <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Dr. Gregorc's Mind Style Models</a> and <a href="http://www.child1st.com/blog/the-concrete-random-learning-style/">The Concrete Random Learning Style</a> with my partner, I started to chuckle about how the qualities (some good, some bad) resonated with me in my own daily life. I looked over at my partner who was nodding her head in agreeance with the bullet points I rambled off about CR thinkers. Charming, Friendly, Charismatic: check! Self-driven by their interests: check! Risk taker: yep! Hates being told exactly what to do and how to do it: that's me! Hard time completing long-term projects: right here!

          I think that the CR thinking style has a pretty good mix of pros and cons to it. We are a creative thinking, problem solving, caring and empathetic, but independent, and potentially controlling, bi-pedal carbon mass. I think those positive qualities will prove vital at DBC, however I am concerned about the independence and controlling behaviors being destructive. That's not to say that independence is a negative quality, but when it is being used to mask the lack of control in a project or situation, it's going to be perceived as destructive.

          My CR-ness in Phase 0 thus far hasn't effected my experience too much, I have actually enjoyed working with pairs during programming. I have not really struggled with anything in relation to my CR thinking style. I think I am really trying to be open to the fact that everyone learns differently, and trying to adapt to others learning styles. I think as I progress through the program that my CR-ness will become more prevalant. On second thought, as I am writing this, just now I have realized that my CR thinking style has effected the way I am spending time on certain challenges. One of the qualities of CR thinkers is that we have a difficult time pacing ourselves and managing our time, specifically working within a time range. I attempted to time box <a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">my previous blog post</a>: I gave myself 90 minutes to complete it, however I ended up taking 120 minutes. While a 1/2 hour isn't the greatest loss of time, the point is that I couldn't finish in the specified time I had set for myself. During a previous challenge, I doubled the amount of time I had allotted for the challenge. I am extremely concerned about my time management moving forward in DBC. I plan on keeping at timeboxing, and shaming myself (on Twitter, perhaps) when I don't stay within those boxes of time.
